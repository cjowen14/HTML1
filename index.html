        The Last Jedi is the most divisive Star Wars movie and one of the most divisive movies of all time. I don't think it deserves the hate that it gets. It seems that because there are a few things people didn't like about the movie, they nitpick and make everything seem like it was bad but that just isn't the case. Is the movie perfect? Absolutely not. But none of the Star Wars movies are perfect by any means. While TLJ has a few issues, its pros far outweigh those issues and create a fantastic cinematic experience.

        No, the picture doesn't reflect my ranking of the movies. It includes all 11 live action movies. To give a little taste of my ranking, here is the middle section:
        <br>
        5. The Force Awakens
        <br>
        6. A New Hope
        <br>
        7. The Rise of Skywalker
        <br>

        Let's Talk About Luke Skywalker

            Most of the situation with Luke is in regards to the sequel trilogy and how he was treated but he gets his own topic because there is just so much to cover. Just like with The Last Jedi (and really the sequels in general), the direction they took Luke receives way too much hate. I have a lot of reasons why  I think the direction they took him makes sense and why it was a great character arc for him.
